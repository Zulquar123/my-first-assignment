            <p>My biggest influence was realizing the tradeoff my parents made in immigrating to the India.
                While neither of them pursued a career in Computer Science, the risk/reward profile they took was
                seared in my brain.

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
                scripting languages such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
                local storage and render the documents
                into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                included cues for the appearance of the document.

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
                including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics.

            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the
                core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.Over 97% of websites use JavaScript
                on the client side for web page behavior often incorporating third-party libraries. All major
                web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                standard.

            <p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of
                machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer
                programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.
                Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year.
                Many programming languages are written in an imperative form , while other languages use the declarative
                form(i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).

            <p>An online community, also called an internet community or web community, is a community whose members
                interact with each other primarily via the Internet. Members of the community usually share common
                interests. For many, online communities may feel like home, consisting of a "family of invisible
                friends"

            <p>As new technology is developed, new roles are needed to help bring that technology to life for the people
                who use it. The options are near-endless: an aspiring programmer could work as a mobile engineer
                creating smartphone apps, or become a game developer and develop interactive content for a variety of
                companies, platforms, and consoles. These are, of course, just two examples of the many available career
                paths open to programmers; countless other programming roles can be built with a sturdy set of
                foundational technical coding and soft skills.
